# website
Website for the OSU Speech, Language, and Music Lab.

Things I (MJH) have noticed:
1. Projects are split in two locations: projectModals.html and featuredProjectModals.html. The latter features all projects on the front page, and the former has the remaining projects. Of course, index.html acually houses the featured projects, oddly enough.
